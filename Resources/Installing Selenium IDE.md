# Installing Selenium IDE

## Foreward
This guide was written after discovering that Firefox version 55 and later will be incompatible with Selenium IDE.

### Feeling Lucky?

Before we start, you may be fortunate enough to still have version 54 installed. If this is the case, we want to keep Firefox from updating and creating more work for us.

Copy and paste this into your Firefox address bar:

`about:preferences#advanced`

Select an option other than Automatically Install Updates.

### Drum Roll... What Version Do You Have?

So what version do you have?

If you have a version that starts with **54**, you are done!

If you have a version that starts with **55** (or higher) you have some more work to do.

### Firefox Version Rollback

- [ ] - Uninstall Firefox
- [ ] - Download [Firefox 54](https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/54.0.1/win32/en-US/Firefox%20Setup%2054.0.1.exe)
- [ ] - Install Firefox 54

### Lock In Your Version

- [ ] - Immediately go to `about:preferences#advanced`
- [ ] - Ensure Updates are not Automatic
- [ ] - You may see a pop-up asking if you would like to "Refresh Your Firefox Experience". **Do not** accept.
