# Installing Python
## Checking Your Architecture
Are you 32-bit or 64-bit?

Type `cmd` in the Windows Search Bar and select the Program "Command Prompt".

If you haven't already, I recommend pinning this to your taskbar.

Enter this command:
`wmic os get osarchitecture`

You should see something that looks like:
```
OSArchitecture
64-Bit
```

Where 64-Bit could also be `32-Bit`

Make a note of this as you'll need it for installing Python.
