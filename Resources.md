## Installing Python

These courses assume you have Windows 10 installed. For earlier versions of Windows, you many find some nuances.

Let's start with installing Python and a Python Editor (IDE) on your PC.

There are two versions of Python. Python 2 and Python 3. Python 2 is a legacy version that is maintained for compatibility. Python 3 is the version that is currently supported and recommended for new users.

Before starting, it is recommended that you download and install the **64-Bit** version if you are running a 64-Bit version of windows. See [How do I know what bit version of windows I have?](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/21726/how-do-i-know-if-im-running-32-bit-or-64-bit-windows-answers/)
