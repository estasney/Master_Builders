## Background

When you perform a screen capture in Windows using <kbd>Windows Key</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> you are capturing a static image.

An animated capture, as seen above, uses a series of images chained together into one file, a **GIF** file (.gif)

## Installation

There are many free options available online. Some I've come across are:

Program | $ 
--- | ---
[Screen Capture](http://www.screentogif.com/) | Free
[Gif Recorder](http://gifrecorder.com/index.htm#.Wabd_lWxSUk) | Freemium. Adds watermark after 7 days
[ShareX](https://getsharex.com/) | Free

I started with Gif Recorder but after the 7 day trial have moved to **Screen to Gif**.

I do find that it can be a resource hog compared to Gif Recorder, but as it's free, I won't complain!

I did try ShareX for a while, but without an integrated Gif Editor I decided to try Screen to Gif.

## What to do with GIFs

After you record an animated screen capture, the GIF will be saved locally to your machine.

If you plan on sharing your GIF with others, I would recommend uploading it to  [Gfycat](https://gfycat.com/) to host the animations. The service is free.

### Embedding GIFS in Word Documents

While you can insert a .gif image into a Word Document, only the first frame will display.

Unfortunately, there is no method to play GIF files directly in Microsoft Word. If you must keep your document in Word Format, you can insert hyperlinks on each image so that double-clicking or pressing <kbd>Ctrl + Left Click</kbd> will open a new window that runs the animation. This will require the reader constantly switching back and forth between the document and another window with the GIF

#### A Recommended Alternative

If you want to play GIFs, the best file format to do so is HTML.

Again, if you plan on sharing the document, I would highly recommend uploading your GIFs to [Gfycat](https://gfycat.com) otherwise you will need to include the gif files *and* ensure that their location remains the same on a different computer.

Check out [Dilinger.io](http://dillinger.io/). This site uses a *very* easy to understand formatting language known as Markdown.

Whenever you'd like to embed a GIF animation, copy the GIF URL (Looks like: ```https://thumbs.gfycat.com/specificurlhere``` ) and type in:

```Markdown
![](gfycat url here)
``` 

You'll immediately see it displayed on the right hand side of the screen!

To share your document, select ```Export -> HTML```

Now you may share your HTML document and it will display as you intended. If you get stuck on Markdown syntax here is an excellent [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
