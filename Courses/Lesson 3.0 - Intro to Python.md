### Installing Python

#### 32 or 64 Bit?
Before getting started you should determine if you have a 32-bit or 64-bit PC. While 32-bit installations will work on 64-bit PC's, you are limiting yourself.

Note that 64-bit will not run on 32-bit machines.

You can find if your machine is 32-bit or 64-bit by visiting: [How do I know what bit version of windows I have?](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/21726/how-do-i-know-if-im-running-32-bit-or-64-bit-windows-answers/)

#### Python 2 or Python 3?
If you need to ask, the answer is **Python 3**. 

#### Where do I download Python?

Python | Version 
 --- |--- | 
[Python 3](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.2/python-3.6.2-amd64-webinstall.exe) | 64-Bit
[Python 3](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.2/python-3.6.2-webinstall.exe) | 32-Bit

#### How do I "open" Python?
While you could run and access Python after installation, you'll want to have an IDE (Integrated Development Environment).

For this course, I will recommend Pycharm Community Edition. It can look a little intimidating at first but don't worry you'll come to love it.
