# HTML

## Why HTML
Keeping with the Lego analogy, HTML can be thought of as Lego blocks. If you've ever played with Legos you know that
there is a huge variety of blocks. Some are more basic, structural blocks whereas others are more specialized.

If we want to navigate *Legoland* we should learn all about these building blocks!
