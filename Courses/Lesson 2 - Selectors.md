# Selectors

## Why Selectors
In Lesson 1 we explored the basic building blocks of the web, HTML. 

Now think of a web page as city and each HTML block as a building in the city.

As with every city, each building will have its own address. As you'll soon find out, there are quite a few ways to navigate our city!

## Selectors Are GPS for your browser
Let's imagine we want to get across town to *Talent Hub's Pizza Palace*. Oh and now it's a food truck.

We could:
1. Google the Address and drive directly to it. (**A Direct Approach**)
2. Ask for directions (**An Indirect Approach**)

### Direct Approaches
*Target Acquired!*

##### Monday
You have provided the exact GPS coordinates for *Pizza Palace*. You get some delicious pizza.

##### Friday
You use the same GPS coordinates for *Pizza Palace*. Unfortunately for you *Pizza Palace* is a food truck and will always be on the move!
While it was easy to Google the coordinate on Monday, you now find yourself having to Google the coordinates every time
you want some delicious pizza.

Now imagine that each time you open a page, the day of the week changes. You will then understand why *Direct Approaches*
can be **fragile**.

### Indirect Approaches
*Using the Force!*

##### Monday
You have the GPS coordinate for *Pizza Palace* but this time you ask a few locals where you can find it. Since it's a food truck, that's a smart move.

Person 1: Look for a "Red" truck
Person 2: *Pizza Palace*
