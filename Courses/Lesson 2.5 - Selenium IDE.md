# Price Tracker
## A Practical Use for XPATH and CSS Selectors
Once you've gotten the hang of XPATH and/or CSS Selectors in [Lesson 2](https://github.com/estasney/Master_Builders/blob/master/Courses/Lesson%202%20-%20Selectors.md), it's time to put your knowledge to use!

If you're skipping around, we'll be using Selenium IDE with Firefox. If you have it successfully installed, great otherwise see this [Guide](https://github.com/estasney/Master_Builders/blob/master/Resources/Installing%20Selenium%20IDE.md) on installing it.

## Some Quick Prep Work

Selenium IDE isn't intended for data-driven uses like our price tracker will require. However, if we remember that as master builders, we specialize in the *unintended* we can craft a solution.

You'll notice that there is not direct support for saving our prices to our PC's. Which is obviously a necessity if we want to track anything over time.

### The Google Forms Solution
I came upon this genius solution in a random post on Stackoverflow so I can't take credit for it, but I *can* highly recommend it as an effective workaround.

I'll assume you have a Google account.

What we want to do is to create a Google Form that our Price Tracker can visit and enter the price it found for the day and then click submit.

#### Create the Form

#### Edit a few things

- [ ] - Name it something
- [ ] - Give Question 1 a Title
- [ ] - Set Answer Type as Short Answer
- [ ] - Keep the URL Handy
