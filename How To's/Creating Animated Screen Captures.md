## Background

When you perform a screen capture in Windows using <kbd>Windows Key</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> you are capturing a static image.

An animated capture, as seen above, uses a series of images chained together into one file, a **GIF** file (.gif)

## Installation

There are many free options available online. Some I've come across are:

Program | $ 
--- | ---
1. [Screen Capture](http://www.screentogif.com/) | Free
2. [Gif Recorder](http://gifrecorder.com/index.htm#.Wabd_lWxSUk) | Freemium. Adds watermark after 7 days
3. [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/) | Free

As of 30AUG2017, I'm currently using Gif Recorder. I find the ability to add subtitles nice to have. However, I will be moving to ShareX after the 7 day trial.

## What to do with GIFs

After you record an animated screen capture, the GIF will be saved locally to your machine.

Since this guide is hosted on the web, they must be hosted online.

I use [Gfycat](https://gfycat.com/) to host the animations. The service is free.
