## Welcome to the Course!
As sourcers, the information that we are after is vastly web-based and in an unstructured format.

Before we cover the fundamentals of Python, it is paramount that you understand how to *Extract* what you need.

Hopefully you are familiar with the movie, *The Lego Movie*. In the movie, *Everything Is Awesome!!!*, everything is 
ordered and structured according to a plan laid out by *Lord Business*

However, there are a few Legolians that resist the order and structure laid out before them. This small group of 
"Master Builders" is notorious for breaking apart Lego buildings and building something that they find useful.

My goal is to inspire you to become "Master Builders" so that if you can dream it, you can build it!

## About The Courses
Courses are structured around completing "Homework" assignments before each group session. 

I've leveraged many of the outstanding tools and courses available free online so that you can explore concepts at your own pace.

No amount of teaching can replace the process of internalizing these concepts through practice.

The group sessions seek to uncover knowledge gaps as well as to reinforce knowledge.

These first few weeks are critical! You *will* be frustrated and may want to quit. But don't give up! By week 3, you will 
be building your own tools!
