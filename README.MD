## Welcome to the Course!
As sourcers, the information that we are after is vastly web-based and in an unstructured format.

Before we cover the fundamentals of Python, it is paramount that you understand how to *Extract* what you need.

Hopefully you are familiar with the movie, *The Lego Movie*. In the movie, *Everything Is Awesome!!!*, everything is 
ordered and structured according to a plan laid out by *Lord Business*

However, there are a few Legolians that resist the order and structure laid out before them. This small group of 
"Master Builders" is notorious for breaking apart Lego buildings and building something that they find useful.

My goal is to inspire you to become "Master Builders" so that you if you can dream it, you can build it!
